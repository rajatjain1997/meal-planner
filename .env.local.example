# OpenAI API Key for ChatGPT Integration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#
# For LOCAL development (npm run dev):
#   - Use VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY here (exposed to browser, but fine for local dev)
#   - This allows npm run dev to work without Vercel CLI
#
# For VERCEL deployment:
#   - Add OPENAI_API_KEY in Vercel project settings (server-side, secure)
#   - The production build uses the /api/chat proxy
